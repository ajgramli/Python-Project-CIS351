### Music Recommendation Project [code](Final.py)

**Description**: This console-based project utilizes the public Spotify API to accept user input for music recommendations. This user will be prompted for an artist, genre, if they want to specify a year of the music's release, and if they would like explicit content. The user can continue to get recommendations until they decide they would like to stop. Once they are done, they will get a list of songs with an artist's name that are similar to their criteria. 

**Key Features**:
+ Spotify API Implementation
+ User Input Handling
+ Customizable Filtering

**Further Enhancements**: 
+ Specify Genres available
+ Produce a text file of the recommended songs

**Implementation and Application**: To try out the program, download the "code" file above and run it in your personal IDE.
